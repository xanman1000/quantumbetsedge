# QuantumBets Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 3 of the QuantumBets project focused on implementing the Content Delivery System. This document summarizes the changes made and provides guidance for next steps.

## Implemented Features

### 1. HTML Picks Integration

- **Content Reception API**
  - Created secure API endpoint (`POST /api/content/receive`) for receiving HTML content from n8n
  - Implemented API key authentication for secure content delivery
  - Added content processing and storage in MongoDB
  - Created content model with analytics tracking capabilities

- **Content Templating**
  - Implemented HTML to plain text conversion for email clients that don't support HTML
  - Created SMS-friendly content formatting
  - Added tier-based content filtering (different content for different subscription tiers)
  - Implemented tracking pixels and link tracking for email analytics

### 2. Automated Distribution

- **Distribution System**
  - Created a controller for triggering content distribution
  - Implemented batch processing to handle large subscriber bases
  - Added delivery tracking with status updates
  - Created retry mechanism for failed deliveries

- **Tier-Based Content Filtering**
  - Implemented content filtering based on subscription tier
  - Free tier receives limited content
  - Paid tiers receive full content with additional features
  - SMS notifications only for paid tiers

- **Delivery Tracking**
  - Created tracking system for email opens and clicks
  - Implemented delivery status tracking (sent, delivered, failed)
  - Added analytics aggregation for reporting
  - Created transparent tracking pixel for email open tracking

## API Endpoints

### Content Management

- `POST /api/content/receive` - Receive HTML content from n8n
  - Headers: `x-api-key: your_api_key`
  - Body: `{ htmlContent: string, title?: string, contentDate?: string }`
  - Response: `{ success: boolean, message: string, data: { contentId: string, title: string, contentDate: string } }`

- `POST /api/content/distribute` - Trigger content distribution
  - Headers: `x-api-key: your_api_key`
  - Body: `{ contentId?: string }` (uses latest content if not provided)
  - Response: `{ success: boolean, message: string, data: { contentId: string, scheduled: number, processed: number, failed: number } }`

- `POST /api/content/retry` - Retry failed deliveries
  - Headers: `x-api-key: your_api_key`
  - Body: `{ maxRetries?: number }` (defaults to 3)
  - Response: `{ success: boolean, message: string, data: { retried: number, processed: number, stillFailed: number } }`

- `GET /api/content` - Get content by date or latest
  - Headers: `x-api-key: your_api_key`
  - Query: `date?: string` (ISO date string, returns latest if not provided)
  - Response: `{ success: boolean, data: Content }`

### Tracking

- `GET /api/tracking/open/:trackingId` - Track email opens
  - Returns: 1x1 transparent GIF

- `GET /api/tracking/click/:trackingId` - Track email clicks
  - Query: `url: string` (URL to redirect to)
  - Returns: Redirect to the original URL

## n8n Integration

To integrate with n8n:

1. Add an HTTP Request node in your n8n workflow
2. Configure it to POST to `http://your-api-url/api/content/receive`
3. Add the header `x-api-key` with your API key
4. Set the body to include:
   ```json
   {
     "htmlContent": "{{$node['HTML_Generation_Node'].data.html}}",
     "title": "Picks for {{$formatDate($now, 'YYYY-MM-DD')}}",
     "contentDate": "{{$now}}"
   }
   ```
5. Add another HTTP Request node to trigger distribution
6. Configure it to POST to `http://your-api-url/api/content/distribute`
7. Add the same API key header
8. Set the body to an empty object `{}` to use the latest content

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables have been added:

- `N8N_API_KEY` - API key for authenticating n8n requests
- `API_URL` - Base URL for the API (used for tracking links)
- `SITE_URL` - Base URL for the frontend (used for links in emails/SMS)

## Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Integration

- Create a content preview page for subscribers
- Implement an archive of past picks
- Add analytics dashboard for administrators

### 2. Testing

- Test the complete flow from n8n to email/SMS delivery
- Verify tracking functionality
- Test tier-based content filtering

### 3. Monitoring

- Implement logging for all delivery events
- Create alerts for high failure rates
- Set up monitoring for API performance

## Technical Debt

- Add more robust error handling for content processing
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add unit tests for content processing and delivery
- Optimize batch processing for very large subscriber bases

## Conclusion

Phase 3 implementation has established the foundation for automated content delivery. The system can now receive HTML content from n8n, process it for different delivery channels, and distribute it to subscribers based on their tier and preferences.
